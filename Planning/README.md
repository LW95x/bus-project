Your product backlog and user stories are the primary evidence of your work.
Every user story marked as “Done” must be linked to concrete evidence, such as:
• A UML diagram
• Source code with corresponding Git commit references
• Acceptance test evidence (e.g. screenshots, logs, or test outputs).
Note: If a story is marked “Done” without evidence, it will not be treated as complete.
