- Design 20%
  - Appropriate class and sequence diagrams linked to user stories
  - Diagrams support understanding of data and interactions
  - Design decisions explained
  - Changes across sprints justified

”Design models” are expected to be lightweight and evolving. You will not be penalised for changing or discarding models between sprints if this is justified.

Every user story marked as “Done” must be linked to concrete evidence, such as:
• A UML diagram
• Source code with corresponding Git commit references
• Acceptance test evidence (e.g. screenshots, logs, or test outputs).
Note: If a story is marked “Done” without evidence, it will not be treated as complete.
