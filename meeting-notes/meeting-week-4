## Marking Criterias

- Planning 20%
	- Two or more well-developed personas with realistic goals and pain points. 
  - Clear product vision derived from personas. 
  - Product backlog is logically structured by features/epics. 
  - Sprint 1 & 2 summaries show prioritisation, learning, and justified change.
  
- User Stories 20%
	- Consistently follow As a  [] I want  [] So that  [] 
	- Focus on user value
	- Small and sprint-sized
	- Clear and testable (Given/When/Then)
	- MoSCoW priorities justified
  
- Design 20%
	- Appropriate class and sequence diagrams linked to user stories
	- Diagrams support understanding of data and interactions
	- Design decisions explained
	- Changes across sprints justified
  
- Working Prototype w/ Implemented Features 20%
	- Video demonstrates 3 core end-to-end features
	- Each feature clearly maps to user stories & acceptance criteria
	- Input > Processing > Output
  
- Testing & Evaluation 20%
	- Two activity diagrams
	- Each diagram describes a non-trivial scenario of interest
	- Include control nodes (start-stop), decision nodes and branching, swim lanes to represent roles or subsystems

  ## Sprint 1 Requirements (Weeks 2-6)
- Stories selected
- Design (class diagram, sequence diagram) 
- Implementation of one core end-to-end feature derived from one or more user stories to demonstrate a working MVP. It can run it locally or online, demonstrate input - processing - output and show a clear connection to the acceptance criteria. 
- Simple web page with: 
	- HTML form
	- Basic backend logic
- Testing explicitly mapped to the stories and acceptance criteria.


## App Idea

Assessment Tracker
1. Form to input a new assessment
2. Assessment Tracker in table form, listed chronologically
	1. Colour formatted to the specific module?
  2. Displays time till assessment
3. Clicking on an assessment displays a new page ->
	1. To-do list
	2. Progress tracker (% completed)
	3. Detailed notes
	4. Countdown to due date/time
	5. Revision materials (saved links)
4. Feature 3 - ?? 

## Planning Requirements

- 2 Personas
- 3 Core user stories -> 3 Core end-to-end features


## TA Questions

1. Personas - what exactly is a persona - can it be two distinctly different students?
2. Ask if our basic idea and core features are acceptable
3. Do we need to adopt Agile practices -> Kanban, scrumming etc.
4. Does it matter how much people contribute to the actual codebase in terms of commits?
5. How detailed do the personas and user stories need to be, given they account for 40% of the total mark?
6. Testing & Evaluation -> Difference between the "activity diagrams" and the class/sequence diagrams from the design phase?
