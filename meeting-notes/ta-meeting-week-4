# TA Meeting Notes Week 4

1. General Product Vision (Vision Statement)
```
FOR (target customer) 
WHO (statement of the need or opportunity) 
The (PRODUCT NAME) is a (product category) 
THAT (key benefit, compelling reason to buy) 
UNLIKE (primary competitive alternative) 
OUR PRODUCT (statement of primary differentiation)
```
2. Try to think of more than 2 personas
Use the lecture slides to guide the development of personas and user stories
1 core user story -> 1 core end-to-end feature (need 3 in total)

Gave an idea for enabling lecturers to add assignments (simple form integration -> could this be considered a feature?)

3. Try to make personas distinctly different (name, backstory, etc. -> colour blind/ADHD considerations - accessibility?)
4. Try to involve everyone in the coding side -> unsure if it actually matters if everyone is involved, said he would clarify with Wendy 
5. Testing & Eval -> unsure, said he would clarify with Wendy
